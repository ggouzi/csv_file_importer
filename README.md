Redmine Issue Importer plugin for Rails 4.x
================

NOT MAINTAINED

This Redmine plugin allows importing issues and time_entries in bulk from csv files. Fields will default to name-based mapping but can be overridden at the confirmation screen.
Existing issues can be updated, and issue relationships and custom fields are supported.
The database is used for intermediate storage.

## Requirements

* Redmine 3.0.0 (Rails 4.x)
* csv gem (class already defined since ruby 1.9.3)
* tempfile gem (class already defined since ruby 1.9.3)
* iconv gem (deprecated since Ruby 1.9.3)
	
## Installation and Setup

To install:
* Install gems if not present in your Gemfile by adding these lines at the end of your Gemfile :
`gem "iconv"`

Then run :
`bundle install`
 
If you can't install iconv because it can't build native extensions make sure you've installed all packages required.
If not, take a look at this page http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html
(This is a recurrent problem. Same issue with nokogiri gem and iconv gem)

Example with Centos 5.11:
`yum install -y gcc ruby-devel zlib-devel`

* Download the plugin to your vendors/plugins directory
* Rename the plugin folder to "redmine_csv_file_importer"
* Run 'bundle exec rake db:migrate_plugins RAILS_ENV=production'
* Restart your redmine as appropriate

To setup :
* Select a project and clic on "Configuration" â†’  "Modules", then enable importer plugin.
* Set permissions according to your needs
* To import time entries, you need to define an issue customized field whose name must be "CSV-IMP-ID" and assign it to appropriates trackers. This customize field is used to bind issues with csv file.

* One header row.
* One or more data rows.

## Credits

This plugin was created by merging two plugins :
* Redmine Issue Importer plugin (https://github.com/yoshidayo/redmine_importer) which allows you to import issues from csv files.
Compatible with Rails 4.x.
It is an improvment of the plugin Redmine Issue Importer plugin (https://github.com/leovitch/redmine_importer)
* Redmine Csv File Importer plugin (https://github.com/danypoup/redmine_csv_file_importer)
with which you can import issues and time entries from csv files for Rails 2.x
It is a mix between the Redmine Issue Importer plugin (https://github.com/leovitch/redmine_importer) and the Bulk Time Entry Plugin (https://github.com/edavis10/redmine-bulk_time_entry_plugin), plus some minor improvements.

Thanks to their creator : Yoshidayo, Dany Poupard, Leo Hourtvitz and Eric Davis.
